This is a collection of unicode emojis that I put together to act as code for supply chain economics within cyberspace. I don't really know what I'm doing most of the time but I'm doing what I was trained to do in my education. Dreaming up new ways to do things and writing about what I understand for others to learn and do what they can to progress science. I do not own the unicode characters in this collection. They are simply emojis that I liked when I researched the world. You can research online to find your own characters to build your own brainchild documentation.
